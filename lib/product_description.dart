  final String burger="Ah, the burger. A handheld symphony of savory bliss. Imagine a juicy, griddled patty, its sear locking in the meaty essence."
      "Cradled in a toasted bun, it becomes a throne for a vibrant court of toppings. Crisp lettuce, tangy tomato, creamy mayo, and the sharp bite of pickles – each a loyal subject."
      "But the burger's true beauty lies in its endless variations. A classic cheeseburger, melty cheese crowning the patty like a molten trophy. A smoky bacon cheeseburger, its salty swagger undeniable. Veggie burgers, bursting with plant-based brilliance, prove meat isn't the only king. Spicy salsas, exotic glazes, and gourmet cheeses – the burger welcomes all, transforming into a global ambassador of taste."
      "From messy backyard barbecues to fancy gourmet joints, the burger reigns supreme. It's a symbol of casual indulgence, a hearty hug on a plate. So grab a napkin, sink your teeth in, and revel in the messy, glorious joy that is the burger. It's more than just food; it's an experience, a celebration of flavor, and a testament to human ingenuity in the realm of deliciousness.";
